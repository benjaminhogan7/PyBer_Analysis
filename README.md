# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to look at several key metrics in PyBer's ridesharing product and how they interrelate in different types of markets: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This analyis looked at roughly 2,300 rides in 120 over a four month period in 2019, looking at the the fares and average fares, number of drivers and average numbers of drivers, and count of rides in the three types of markets, culminating in a chart that compares total fares by city type over the period January through the end of April, 2019.

## Results

Unsurprisingly, the largest portion of fares, rides, and drivers are centered in cities that are classified as urban. Likely there are many reasons for this including a younger demographic, residents less likely to own a personal car, and earlier adoptors of technology in urban cities, whereas rural and suburban residents are more likely to own cars due to how spread out those environements are. The figures below showcase this.

What is interesting about these charts, is that they show that despite cities accounts for 68.4% of all rides on PyBer during this time period, the urban cities have 80.9% of all PyBer drivers. It is not clear from this data set whether large portions of urban drivers drive part-time or rarely, contributing to this overrepresentation. What does seem to happen, however, is that the average fares decreases as the number of drivers increases as shown below. More careful study of this should be taken to determine if this is a cause-effect relationship, if this has more to do population density, some combination of the two, or other factors.

A table showing the breakdown of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver can be found below.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I would recommend the following to the CEO:

* Invest broadly in incentives for bringing new drivers on board, particularly in Suburban and Rural environments. The average fare per customer in these areas are higher than in Urban cities and finding methods of lowering these fares, as well as increasing the availability of drivers, may have the effect on attracting customers, allowing PyBer to grow.
* Invest and expand in the Suburban market. Total fares in Suburban cities were just under 50% of those in Urban cities, however, this is from a fraction of the total rides (38%) and total drivers (20%) as compared to Urban cities. This seems like an underutilized market.
* Study further and develop a strategy around average fares per driver. The average fares per driver vary wildly between market types. Rural: $55.48, Suburban: $39.50, and Urban $16.57. As noted above in the analysis, there could be many reasons for this such as, distance of rides, supply and demand of drivers, and the number of hours each driver commits to driving for PyBer. Ideally a strategy would account for these differences and preferences of drivers, however, it would seem on the surface that Urban drivers would be less satisfied with their average fares, despite contributing so much more to the total fares of the company. A smart and successful strategy would find ways to bridge these disparities to ensure longevity and the experience and satisfaction of Urban drivers.
